            Catch an idea 💡! Sweep through the space from left to right for all relevant x-coordinate values and maintain the <strong>set of active disks</strong> at the moment. Each individual disk <code>{% if is_js %}[x, y, r]{% else %}(x, y, r){% endif %}</code> enters the active set when the vertical sweep line reaches the x-coordinate <code>x-r</code>, and leaves the active set when the sweep line reaches <code>x+r</code>. At the time when a disk enters the active set, you need to look for its intersections only in this active set.
